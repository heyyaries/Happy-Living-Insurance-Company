            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2025, Happy Living was born out of a desire to make  insurance simple and
                understandable for everyone. Our founders recognized the complexities and frustrations that often
                accompany  insurance, and they set out to create a company that prioritizes transparency,
                compassion, and support.</p>
